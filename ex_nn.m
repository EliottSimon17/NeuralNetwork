%  Instructions
%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started. 
%  You will need to complete the following functions 
%  
%     predict.m
%     sigmoidGradient.m
%     randInitializeWeights.m
%     nnCostFunction.m
%

%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.

%% Initialization
clear ; close all; clc

%% Setup the parameters you will use for this exercise
input_layer_size  = 400;  % 20x20 Input Images of Digits
hidden_layer_size = 25;   % 25 hidden units
num_labels = 10;          % 10 labels, from 1 to 10   
                          % (note that we have mapped "0" to label 10)

%% =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
%  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
%  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.
%

% Load Training Data
fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

load('digitdata.mat');
m = size(X, 1);

% Randomly select 100 data points to display
sel = randperm(size(X, 1));
sel = sel(1:100);

displayData(X(sel, :));

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;

%% ================ Part 2: Loading Pameters ================
% In this part of the exercise, we load some pre-initialized 
% neural network parameters.

fprintf('\nLoading Saved Neural Network Parameters ...\n')

% Load the weights into variables Theta1 and Theta2
load('debugweights.mat');

% Unroll parameters
nn_params = [Theta1(:) ; Theta2(:)];

%% ================= Part 3: Implement Predict =================
%  After training the neural network, we would like to use it to predict
%  the labels. You will now implement the "predict" function to use the
%  neural network to predict the labels of the training set. This lets
%  you compute the training set accuracy.

pred = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X);

fprintf('\nTraining Set Accuracy: %f\n', mean(double(pred == y)) * 100);

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;
 
%  To give you an idea of the network's output, you can also run
%  through the examples one at the a time to see what it is predicting.
%  Change the value of the show_examples variable to true to view examples.
show_examples = false;

if show_examples
    %  Randomly permute examples
    rp = randperm(m);

    for i = 1:m
        % Display 
        fprintf('\nDisplaying Example Image\n');
        displayData(X(rp(i), :));

        pred = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X(rp(i),:));
        fprintf('\nNeural Network Prediction: %d (digit %d)\n', pred, mod(pred, 10));
    
        % Pause
        fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
        pause;
    end
end

%% ================ Part 4: Sigmoid Gradient  ================
%  Before you start implementing backpropagation, you will first
%  implement the gradient for the sigmoid function. You should complete the
%  code in the sigmoidGradient.m file.
%

fprintf('\nEvaluating sigmoid gradient...\n')

g = sigmoidGradient([-15 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 15]);
fprintf('Sigmoid gradient evaluated at [-15 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 15]:\n  ');
fprintf('%f ', g);
fprintf('\n\n');

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;


%% ================ Part 5: Initializing Pameters ================
%  To learn a two layer neural network that classifies digits. You will start
%  by implementing a function to initialize the weights of the neural network
%  (randInitializeWeights.m)

fprintf('\nInitializing Neural Network Parameters ...\n')

initial_Theta1 = randInitializeWeights(input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size);
initial_Theta2 = randInitializeWeights(hidden_layer_size, num_labels);

% Unroll parameters
initial_nn_params = [initial_Theta1(:) ; initial_Theta2(:)];


%% =============== Part 6: Implement Backpropagation ===============
%  Now you will implement the backpropagation algorithm for the neural 
%  network. You should add code to nnCostFunction.m to return the partial
%  derivatives of the parameters.
%
fprintf('\nChecking Backpropagation... \n');

%  Check gradients by running checkNNGradients
checkNNGradients;

fprintf('\nProgram paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;


%% =============== Part 7: Implement Regularization ===============
%  Once your backpropagation implementation is correct, you should now
%  continue to implement the regularization gradient.
%

fprintf('\nChecking Backpropagation (w/ Regularization) ... \n')

%  Check gradients by running checkNNGradients
lambda = 3;
checkNNGradients(lambda);

% Also output the costFunction debugging values
debug_J  = nnCostFunction(nn_params, input_layer_size, ...
                          hidden_layer_size, num_labels, X, y, lambda);

fprintf(['\n\nCost at (fixed) debugging parameters (w/ lambda = 10): %f ' ...
         '\n(this value should be about 0.576051)\n\n'], debug_J);

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;


%% =================== Part 8: Training NN ===================
%  You have now implemented all the code necessary to train a neural 
%  network. To train your neural network, we will now use "fmincg", which
%  is a function which works similarly to "fminunc". Recall that these
%  advanced optimizers are able to train our cost functions efficiently as
%  long as we provide them with the gradient computations.
%
fprintf('\nTraining Neural Network... \n')

%  After you have completed the assignment, change the MaxIter to a larger
%  value to see how more training helps.
options = optimset('MaxIter', 50);

%  You should also try different values of lambda
lambda = 1;

% Create "short hand" for the cost function to be minimized
costFunction = @(p) nnCostFunction(p, ...
                                   input_layer_size, ...
                                   hidden_layer_size, ...
                                   num_labels, X, y, lambda);

% Now, costFunction is a function that takes in only one argument (the
% neural network parameters)
[nn_params, cost] = fmincg(costFunction, initial_nn_params, options);

% Obtain Theta1 and Theta2 back from nn_params
Theta1 = reshape(nn_params(1:hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1)), ...
                 hidden_layer_size, (input_layer_size + 1));

Theta2 = reshape(nn_params((1 + (hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1))):end), ...
                 num_labels, (hidden_layer_size + 1));

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;


%% ================= Part 9: Visualize Weights =================
%  You can now "visualize" what the neural network is learning by 
%  displaying the hidden units to see what features they are capturing in 
%  the data.

fprintf('\nVisualizing Neural Network... \n')

displayData(Theta1(:, 2:end));

fprintf('\nProgram paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;

%% ============= Part 10: Predicting with learned weights =======
%  After training the neural network, we would like to use it to predict
%  the labels. The already implemented "predict" function is used by
%  neural network to predict the labels of the training set. This lets
%  you compute the training set accuracy.

pred = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X);

fprintf('\nTraining Set Accuracy: %f\n', mean(double(pred == y)) * 100);
